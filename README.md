# NodeJs-PappuaCoffee
# NodeJs-PapuaCoffee Backend Documentation

This document offers a detailed exploration of the NodeJs-PapuaCoffee platform's backend, focusing on its architecture, functionalities, and the strategic roles of the `app`, `utils`, and other directories.

## Project Structure Overview

The backend is organized into several key directories that manage the application's core logic, utilities, and configurations.

### App Directory

The `app` directory is central to the application, containing subdirectories for routers, models, and HTTP logic, alongside the server initialization file.

#### Key Components

- **`server.js`**
  - **Purpose**: Initializes the application server with basic configurations, middleware, and routes.
  - **Functionality**: Sets up middleware for parsing requests, handling sessions, and managing server routes.

#### Subdirectories

- **`routers/`**
  - Contains routing logic to handle different endpoint requests for users and coffee-related operations.
  - **`coffees/`**: Routes for coffee item interactions like listing, adding, or updating coffee products.
  - **`users/`**: Manages user authentication and profile management routes.

- **`models/`**
  - **`user.js`**, **`coffee.js`**: Define data structures for users and coffee items, facilitating data operations and integrity.

- **`http/`**
  - Houses the middleware, validations, and controllers that process HTTP requests.
  - **`middlewares/`**: Includes `VerifyAccessToken.js` for authentication and `checkErrors.js` for error handling.
  - **`validations/`**: Contains `public.js` for validating public-facing inputs.
  - **`controllers/`**: Implements business logic for user and coffee operations.

### Utils Directory

Provides utility functions and helpers that enhance functionality and modularity.

#### Utilities

- **Files such as `constants.js`**, **`function.js`**, and **`multer.js`**
  - **Purpose**: Offer reusable logic like constant values, common functions, and file upload handling.
  - **Functionality**: These utilities support various application features, from handling file uploads to generating secret keys with `secret_key_generator.js`.

## Key Features

1. **Robust Routing System**: Well-organized routes in the `routers` directory ensure efficient request management and endpoint organization.
2. **Comprehensive Data Modeling**: The `models` directory provides clear, efficient data schemas for user and coffee data, ensuring data integrity and facilitating database interactions.
3. **Advanced Middleware Usage**: Middleware in the `http` directory helps manage authentication, error handling, and data validation, promoting secure and reliable operations.
4. **Scalable Controllers**: Controllers separate business logic from routing logic, making the codebase easier to manage and scale.
5. **Utility Functions**: The `utils` directory contains essential tools and functions that enhance code reusability and project maintainability.
6. **Error Handling**: Integrated error checking and response management help maintain a stable and user-friendly service environment.
7. **Secure Authentication**: The use of access tokens to verify user sessions ensures that endpoints are protected against unauthorized access.
8. **Dynamic Data Validation**: Validation scripts ensure that all incoming data meets the application's requirements, reducing the risk of errors and data corruption.
9. **Efficient File Handling**: Utilities for file handling support media operations within the application, essential for features like profile pictures or coffee product images.
10. **Developer-friendly Documentation**: Detailed Swagger documentation for API routes aids developers in understanding and integrating backend functionalities.
